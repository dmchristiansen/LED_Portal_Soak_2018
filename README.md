# LED Portal Soak 2018

This is for an art installation that was brought to Soak 2018.

This code is made to run on a raspberry pi, to control an led panel of ~650 SK9822 adressable LEDs.  It is connected to a button pad over I2C, and in response to presses sends pulses of light shooting across the panel.
The interactions of the pulses are meant to create interesting patterns.

Eventually, I intend to add a multi-voice modal synthesis oscillator that is controlled by the state of the pulses...this is a very rough first draft of this art piece.
